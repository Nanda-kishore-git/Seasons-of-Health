   - Verify environment variables are set (OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, etc.)
   - Check if additional test dependencies need installation
   - Review server routing for public files

2. **Further Testing**:
   - Run manual tests through browser
   - Check console logs for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API endpoints are functional
